# One File Tools

A growing collection of useful developer tools, each built as a **single, self-contained HTML file**.

No build step. No dependencies. No frameworks. Just open the file in your browser and it works.

---

## Why?

Most developer tools today come with baggage:

- `npm install` with 200+ packages.
- Framework lock-in.
- Complex build pipelines.
- Servers, databases, deployment configs.

**This repo takes the opposite approach.**

> One tool. One file. Open and use.

Every tool in this collection is a standalone `.html` file containing all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript it needs. You can download a single file, open it in any browser, and start using it immediately, even offline.

## Tech Philosophy

| Principle             | Rule                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One file**          | Each tool is a single `.html` file.                                                         |
| **Zero dependencies** | No npm, no CDN required (CDN optional for styling).                                         |
| **Browser only**      | Runs entirely client-side.                                                                  |
| **Beginner friendly** | Code should be readable and learnable, even if AI is used, make sure to comment humane way. |
| **Works offline**     | No server calls unless the tool’s purpose requires it.                                      |
| **Mobile ready**      | Responsive design on every tool.                                                            |

## SSoC (Social Summer of Code)

This repository is a proud participant in **[Social Summer of Code (SSoC)](https://portal.socialsummerofcode.com/)**, an Open Source programme that helps students and beginners contribute to real-world projects.

### How SSoC works here

2. Pick an issue labeled `Easy` or `Medium`
3. Comment on the issue to get assigned
4. Follow the [Contributing Guide](Contributing.md) to submit your PR
5. Get your PR reviewed, merged, and earn your contribution points

### Contribution labels

| Label    | Points | What it means                                                                          |
