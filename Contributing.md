## Philosophy

Every tool in this repository follows one core principle:

> **One tool. One file. Open and use.**

This means:

- Each tool lives in a **single `.html` file**.
- It must work by simply **opening the file in a browser**.
- **No build step**, no `npm install`, no framework.
- Code should be **readable**, someone learning web development should be able to understand it.
- It should work **offline** whenever possible.

## Types of Contributions

Every pull request should fall into one of these categories:

| Type              | Description                                                                     | Label             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **New Tool**      | Build a tool from the [Ideas Board](ReadMe.md#ideas-board) or propose your own. | `Easy` / `Medium` |
| **Enhancement**   | Improve an existing tool - UI, UX, features, accessibility, performance.        | `Easy` / `Medium` |
| **Bug Fix**       | Fix something that’s broken.                                                    | `Easy` / `Medium` |
| **Documentation** | Improve docs, add code comments, fix typos.                                     | `Easy`            |

## Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues:** Someone may already be working on the same tool.
2. **Check existing PRs:** Avoid duplicate effort
3. **Claim your issue:** Comment on the issue saying you’d like to work on it. Wait for assignment before starting
4. **One tool per PR:** Keep your pull requests focused. Don’t bundle multiple tools into one PR

### Proposing a new idea

If your tool idea isn’t on the Ideas Board:

1. Open a [New Tool Idea](https://github.com/praveenscience/One-File-Tools/issues/new?template=new-tool-idea.yml) issue using the issue template.
2. Fill in the tool name, filename, category, description, features, and suggested difficulty.
3. The maintainer will review it, assign a difficulty label, and add it to the board.

For bug reports or enhancements to existing tools, use the appropriate [issue template](https://github.com/praveenscience/One-File-Tools/issues/new/choose).

---

## Building a New Tool

### Step 1 — Fork & clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/One-File-Tools.git
cd One-File-Tools
```

### Step 2 — Create a branch

#### Creating a New Tool

```bash
git checkout -b add/your-tool-name
git checkout -b new/json-formatter
```

Use the `add/` / `new/` prefix for new tools.

#### Enhancing an Existing Tool

```bash
git checkout -b feat/json-formatter
```

Use the `feat/` for enhancements.

#### Fixing Bug in an Existing Tool

```bash
git checkout -b fix/json-formatter
```

Use the `fix/` for bug fixes.

### Step 3 — Create or Edit your file

```bash
touch tools/your-tool-name.html
vim tools/your-tool-name.html
```

### Step 4 — Build your tool

Use the template below as a starting point:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Tool Name — One File Tools</title>
    <style>
      /* ========================================
       Reset & Base
       ======================================== */
      *,
      *::before,
      *::after {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }

      body {
        font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, sans-serif;
        line-height: 1.6;
        padding: 2rem;
        max-width: 960px;
        margin: 0 auto;
        background: #fafafa;
        color: #1a1a1a;
      }

      /* ========================================
       Dark Mode
       ======================================== */
      @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        body {
          background: #0a0a0a;
          color: #e5e5e5;
        }
      }

      /* ========================================
       Your styles here
       ======================================== */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Tool Name</h1>
      <p>A brief description of what this tool does.</p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <!-- Your tool UI here -->
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>Part of <a href="https://github.com/praveenscience/One-File-Tools">One File Tools</a></p>
    </footer>

    <script>
      // Your JavaScript here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 5 — Register your tool

Add an entry for your tool in `tools.json` (inside the `"tools"` array). Follow the existing entries as a guide — you'll need these fields:

```json
{
  "id": "your-tool-name",
  "name": "Your Tool Name",
  "shortDescription": "A one-line summary of what the tool does.",
  "longDescription": "## Your Tool Name\n\nA longer description with a ### Features section.",
  "category": "css",
  "tags": ["relevant", "tags"],
  "techStack": ["CSS3", "HTML5", "Vanilla JS"],
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "status": "live"
}
```

Valid category IDs: `accessibility`, `browser-network`, `color`, `css`, `utilities`, `image`, `json-api`, `text`, `web-seo`.

### Step 6 — Add a screenshot

Take a screenshot of your tool and save it as `tools/your-tool-name.png` (same name as the HTML file, kebab-case).

### Step 7 — Build and verify

Run the build script to regenerate the landing page, then open `index.html` to verify your tool appears:

```bash
node build.js
open index.html
```

### Step 8 — Test

- Open the file directly in your browser (`open tools/your-tool-name.html`).
- Test on Chrome and Firefox at minimum.
- Test on mobile (resize your browser or use DevTools responsive mode).
- Check for console errors.
- Verify it works offline (disconnect and reload).

### Step 9 — Submit

```bash
git add tools/your-tool-name.html tools/your-tool-name.png tools.json
git commit -m "Add: your-tool-name"
git push origin add/your-tool-name
```

Then open a Pull Request following the [PR process below](#pull-request-process).

## Enhancing an Existing Tool

Enhancements are valuable contributions! Some examples:

- Adding **dark mode** support.
- Improving **responsive design** for mobile.
- Adding **keyboard shortcuts**.
- Improving **accessibility** (ARIA labels, focus management, screen reader support).
- Adding **copy to clipboard** functionality.
- Better **error handling** and user feedback.
- Performance improvements.
- Adding **export** options (download, share).

### Branch naming for enhancements

```bash
git checkout -b feat/tool-name-what-you-changed
# Example: feat/json-formatter-dark-mode
```

## Tool Requirements

### Must have

- [ ] Single `.html` file, all HTML, CSS, and JS in one file.
- [ ] Works by opening the file in a browser, no server required.
- [ ] No build step.
- [ ] Responsive design, works on desktop and mobile.
- [ ] No console errors.
- [ ] No tracking scripts, analytics, or advertisements.
- [ ] Has a clear title and description in the page.
- [ ] Includes a link back to the repo in the footer.
- [ ] Prettier formatted in the given configuration.

### Should have

- [ ] Dark mode support (at minimum via `prefers-color-scheme`).
- [ ] Keyboard accessible, all interactive elements reachable via Tab.
- [ ] Semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<label>`, etc.).
- [ ] Works offline.

### May have

- [ ] A CDN link for styling (e.g., Tailwind CSS via CDN), this is acceptable but up to you.
- [ ] Google Fonts for typography — acceptable, but use the system font stack from the template if you want zero external requests.
- [ ] External API calls, only if the tool’s core purpose requires it (e.g., DNS lookup). The tool should degrade gracefully without the API.

### Must not have

- [ ] External JavaScript frameworks / heavy UI libraries (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
- [ ] `npm install` or any package manager dependency.
- [ ] Tracking or analytics of any kind.
- [ ] Ads or monetization.
- [ ] Server Side Requirements.

## File Naming Convention

Use **kebab-case**. The filename should clearly describe the tool.

```
Good:
  json-formatter.html
  color-picker.html
  og-generator.html
  contrast-checker.html
  uuid-generator.html

Bad:
  JSONFormatter.html
  jsonFormatter.html
  tool1.html
  my-awesome-tool.html
```

---

## Code Style

Keep it simple and readable. Someone learning web development should be able to read your code and learn from it.

### HTML

- Use semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<label>`, `<button>`).
- Include `lang="en"` on `<html>`.
- Include viewport meta tag.
- Use descriptive `id` and `class` names.

### CSS

- Group styles with clear section comments.
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming.
- Mobile-first or responsive approach.
- Prefer modern CSS (flexbox, grid) over floats or hacks.

### JavaScript

- Use modern JS (ES6+) - `const`, `let`, arrow functions, template literals.
- Use `addEventListener` - no inline `onclick`.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Add brief comments for non-obvious logic.

### Prettier Format

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent code formatting. If you use VS Code, install the Prettier extension and it will pick up the config automatically.

**Key settings:**

- **Print Width:** No forced wrapping (long lines are fine)
- **Tab Width:** 2 spaces
- **Tabs:** Spaces, not tabs
- **Semicolons:** Always
- **Quotes:** Double quotes
- **Trailing Commas:** None
- **Arrow Parens:** Always (`(x) => x`, not `x => x`)
- **Bracket Spacing:** `{ foo }` not `{foo}`
- **Bracket Same Line:** No (`>` of multi-attribute HTML tags goes on a new line)
- **End of Line:** LF
- **Single Attribute Per Line:** No
- **Quote Props:** As needed (only quote object keys when required)
- **Prose Wrap:** Preserve (don’t rewrap Markdown or text)
- **Embedded Language Formatting:** Auto (JS and CSS inside HTML get formatted too)
- **Object Wrap:** Preserve (keeps your object layout as written)

A `.prettierrc` file already exists at the project root. If you need to recreate it, here are the settings:

```json
{
  "printWidth": 80000,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": false,
  "trailingComma": "none",
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "endOfLine": "lf",
  "singleAttributePerLine": false,
  "bracketSameLine": false,
  "quoteProps": "as-needed",
  "proseWrap": "preserve",
  "embeddedLanguageFormatting": "auto",
  "objectWrap": "preserve",
  "htmlWhitespaceSensitivity": "css"
}
```

Run Prettier before submitting:

```bash
npx prettier --write tools/your-tool-name.html
```

> **Note:** The `printWidth: 80000` is intentional — it effectively means “never auto-wrap lines”. This is by design, not a typo.

## Pull Request Process

### PR title format

```
Add: tool-name            — for new tools
Improve: tool-name - what — for enhancements
Fix: tool-name - what     — for bug fixes
Docs: what changed        — for documentation
```

### PR description

When you open a PR, a **template** will be pre-filled with the required sections. Fill in:

1. **What** — What does this tool do / what did you change? Link the related issue with `Closes #123`.
2. **Type of Change** — Check whether it’s a new tool, enhancement, bug fix, or docs update.
3. **Screenshot** — Required for new tools and UI changes.
4. **Checklist** — Go through the checklist and confirm you’ve met the requirements.

### What happens after you submit

1. The maintainer (@praveenscience) will review your PR.

## Review & Labels

### Difficulty labels

| Label    | Meaning                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Easy`   | Straightforward tool with a single clear purpose and minimal logic       |
| `Medium` | Tool with multiple features, interactive elements, or more complex logic |

There are **no `Hard` labels** in this project. The single-file constraint naturally keeps scope manageable.

### Who assigns labels?

Difficulty labels are assigned by the maintainer ([@praveenscience](https://github.com/praveenscience)). If you feel a label is too high or too low, you’re welcome to discuss it in the issue / PR, labels are **slightly negotiable**.

### Review expectations

- PRs are reviewed in the order they’re received.
- Simple, clean PRs get merged faster within 48 hours or less.
- If changes are requested, respond within **2 days** or the PR may be closed.
- Be kind and respectful in all interactions.

## SSoC Contributors

Welcome to **Social Summer of Code**! Here’s what you need to know:

### Quick start for SSoC

1. Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/praveenscience/One-File-Tools/issues) tab.
2. Filter by `Easy` or `Medium` labels.
3. Find an unassigned issue.
4. Comment: _“I’d like to work on this as a part of SSoC”_.
5. Wait for assignment (do not start before being assigned).
6. Fork, build, and submit your PR.
7. Include `SSoC` in your PR description for tracking.
8. Include the “Fixes: #Issue” as a part.

### SSoC ground rules

- **One issue at a time:** Complete your current task before picking up another.
- **Claim before you code:** Always get assigned first.
- **Original work only:** AI-generated tools without understanding will be rejected. You should be able to explain every line of your code.
- **No spam PRs:** Low-effort PRs (renaming variables, adding unnecessary comments, trivial whitespace changes) will be closed and may result in being blocked.
- **Ask questions:** If you’re stuck, comment on the issue. The maintainer and community are here to help.

### Earning points

- Your contribution earns points based on the difficulty label of the issue.
- Points are tracked on the [SSoC leaderboard](https://portal.socialsummerofcode.com/leaderboard).
- Quality matters more than quantity - one well-built tool is worth more than five half-finished ones.
